ðŸ“¨ DApps Message on Monad Testnet

DApps Message is a simple decentralized application (DApp) built on the Monad Testnet that allows users to send and read on-chain messages. It serves as a proof of concept for basic communication on a high-performance, EVM-compatible blockchain.

âœ¨ Key Features:
Send public messages to the blockchain

View all messages stored on-chain

Smart contract written in Solidity

Frontend built with React + Ethers.js

Runs on Monad Testnet

ðŸš€ Tech Stack:
Monad Testnet

Solidity

Hardhat

React.js

Ethers.js

dotenv (for environment configuration)

ðŸ§ª Purpose:
This project is intended as a learning experiment and a foundational prototype for building more advanced decentralized communication tools on Monad.
